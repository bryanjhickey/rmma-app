              The impacts of COVID-19 are significant for all martial arts
              academies. Being closed for business and more importantly limited
              in the ways we could connect with our team hurt. That’s why we are
              committed to keeping our facilities, staff and members as safe as
              possible with our COVID-19 Safety Policy in line with health
              recommendations.
