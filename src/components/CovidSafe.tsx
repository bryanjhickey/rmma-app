              The impacts of COVID-19 are significant for all martial arts
              academies. Being closed for business and more importantly limited
              in the ways we could connect with our team hurt. Thatâ€™s why we are
              committed to keeping our facilities, staff and members as safe as
              possible with our COVID-19 Safety Policy in line with health
              recommendations.
